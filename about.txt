- git status : gives you informations about your working directory.

- working directory : is the project folder with all the project files in it.

- to manage our project by git we need in our working directory  : (.git =>hidden folder) repository that contains  the staging Area(Index file) and Commits(objects folder).

- git init :initialise our git repository.

- git status :  shows  that we are in master branch.

- master branch contains all our commits.

- git add file_name : add untracked file showed by git status to our staging area.

- git add . : add all untracked files to the staging area

- git commit -m  : each commit has a specific message.
- account identity : 
	*git config -- global user.email "my-email"
	*git config --global user.name "sbarkadev"

- git log :command that gives us access to all our commits in our current branch.
	- commit id 
	- when the commit was created 
	- the commit message

- for each commit we create we have a unique id : this id make it easy to specifically load or check out the commit with that id .

- git log : latest commit always in top 

- the cool thing about version management : if we want to go back to our previous commit , we get the id of the commit from git log ; to load a specific commit : git checkout (commit_id)


- git checkout commit_id
- git log
- git checkout master  : go back to our commits after a checkout
